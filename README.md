Julia Notebooks on Geometrical Anatomy of Theoretical Physics 

This is a series of Julia notebooks that will serve two main goals.

Firstly, I will be trying to learn the course by Frederic Schuller on
[Geometrical Anatomy of Theoretical Physics][ttps://youtu.be/V49i_LM8B0E] This
set of notebooks will serve as my notes taken during the watching of lectures.

Secondly, I will explore the possibility and best structure of organizing the
materials of a math/physics course with the help of Julia.
